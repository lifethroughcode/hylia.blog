A list of tech related products I recommend both free and paid. 

# VPN & Email

[Proton](https://proton.me/) is a private and secure platform that provides Email, VPN, Cloud Storage, and a Password Manager. 

There is a free version, but the Proton Unlimited plan is very cheap considering how much you get for your money, see pricing and features here - https://proton.me/mail/pricing
