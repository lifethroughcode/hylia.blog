A list of tech related products I recommend both free and paid.



# VPN & Email

[Proton](https://proton.me/) is a private and secure platform that provides Email, VPN, Cloud Storage, and a Password Manager. 

There is a free version, but the Proton Unlimited plan is very cheap considering how much you get for your money, see pricing and features here - [Pricing/Features](https://proton.me/mail/pricing)



# Two Factor Authentication

[Aegis](https://getaegis.app/) is an alternative to proprietary two factor authentication apps like Google Authenticator and Authy. Its most important features, are security and backups.

**It is currently only available on Android devices via PlayStore or F-Droid.**



# **Password Manager**

[Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) is a great password manager, it can be used as a free cloud account, or you can get additional features with one of their very cheap paid plans. If you are more technical you can also host it yourself on your own server.
