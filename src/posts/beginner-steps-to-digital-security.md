##### *It's been a while since I last made a post here - a little too long!*

##### *I am going to try post here at least once a month going forward. I had a few messages from people that found my last post about Proton VPN helpful, and that was really nice to see, and has prompted me to make a bit more effort with this blog.*

Our whole lives are connected to the internet, so it's important to understand some ways you can protect yourself.

This post is going to cover a few things you can do, or should be aware of, that will help you become more secure online. I see a lot of people on a daily basis that are not security conscious at all, or do not understand the importance of online security. 

# \#1 Use a password manager

This is the first step I would recommend to everyone, get control over your online accounts and secure them properly. 

There are several options for helping organise your accounts and passwords, the main one I recommend is Bitwarden, it's easy to get started and using the cloud option means your passwords will sync between devices.

This will allow you to create random passwords for your accounts rather than the same 3 passwords for everything! With a password manager you don't need to know your passwords, they should be completely random. You can then copy the password from your vault, or even use auto-fill features via browser extensions or mobile apps. 

There are many others on the market but this is the one I have the most experience with. I would like to try Proton Pass at some point as I'm interested in the SimpleLogin integration for email aliases, so I may migrate to that eventually.

If your technical skills are more advanced you could host Bitwarden yourself, or use something like KeyPassXC. But if you want a hassle/maintenance free password manager that just works I would not recommend this. 

Just make sure you use a good master password, and take regular backups!! A USB with a Veracrypt volume is a great way to have a last resort backup - <https://bitwarden.com/resources/guide-how-to-create-and-store-a-backup-of-your-bitwarden-vault/>

# \#2 Two Factor Authentication

Often referred to as 2FA or MFA (multi factor authentication).

When you login to site or service, you will be prompted to enter a code which is sent or created from another device. The most common one's seen are text based authentication where the site will send a code to the mobile number on the account. This is ok, but not as secure as using an authenticatior app, like Aegis, Authy, Google Authenticator, etc. 

MAke sure to backup your seed codes. 



Make sure to set up 2fa on your password manager!!!!

browser externsions and apps

be careful what you post online, whatsapp pictures are public

make sure you have backups unencrypted and save them to a veracrypt volume on usb.
