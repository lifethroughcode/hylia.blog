Starting a blog has been something I've wanted to do for quite some time, it's a way for me to log information for future use (i.e. how-to guides), as I can come back and see how I set up a certain piece of software, etc. It's also a way for me to put down thoughts and ideas, and maybe it will be helpful to someone else on the internet too. 

> ESXi on a Raspberry Pi 4 🤯

I've been working on a few things recently, from my website and blog, to also creating a home server running ESXi on a Raspberry Pi 4. I enjoy learning new technologies and look forward to sharing my journey. Most of the content I post will likely be tech related, however on the odd occasion I may also post about something else that interests me such as Japan! 

Keep an eye out for my next post, but until then - here's a picture of a lucky cat (called maneki-neko 招き猫 (beckoning cat) in Japan).
